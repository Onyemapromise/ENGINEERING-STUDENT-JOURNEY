This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of students’ academic journey, extracurricular involvement, and post-graduation outcomes.
Introduction
This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of students’ academic journey, extracurricular involvement, and post-graduation outcomes. It captures key information such as personal demographics, academic performance across all semesters, participation in clubs, skill sets, internships, and placement records. With fields like GPA trends, backlogs, and placement domains, this dataset is ideal for analyzing factors that influence student success, employability, and alumni trajectories across different branches of study.

Data Preparation Procedure
Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, filled missing values, and standardized formats (e.g., GPA to 2 decimal places).

Data Transformation: Converted categorical values (e.g., Gender, Branch, Placement Status) to consistent labels.

Feature Engineering: Calculated total GPA, average GPA per year, and encoded club participation and skills.

Normalization: Scaled GPA and Attendance for uniform analysis.

Validation: Ensured data accuracy and readiness for analysis.

Dependent Variable

Average GPA


Potential Questions

These are insights stakeholders might want to uncover:

What factors are most strongly associated with a high GPA?

Does club participation influence academic performance?

Is there a correlation between attendance and backlogs?

Are students in certain branches more likely to have backlogs?

Does gender impact GPA or attendance?

How do technical skills relate to academic success?

Are students with backlogs attending fewer classes on average?

Is age associated with differences in GPA or backlogs?


Potential Analyses

These are data analyses you can conduct with this dataset:

Correlation matrix between GPA, attendance, backlogs, and age.

Regression analysis to predict GPA based on attendance, backlogs, and skills.

Clustering to group students based on performance and involvement (GPA, clubs, skills).

Chi-square test to evaluate the relationship between gender and backlogs.

Branch-wise GPA analysis using bar charts and ANOVA.

Attendance distribution analysis to identify patterns across student groups.

Backlog frequency analysis by branch, gender, or club involvement.

Skill set heatmap comparing frequency of skills among high vs. low GPA students.


Observations

Research-based internships are strongly associated with higher academic performance.

Students in CIVIL and MECH departments maintain the highest GPA scores.

Coding Club stands out as a productive extracurricular, associated with the highest GPA among clubs.

CSE branch underperforms in GPA compared to other branches, suggesting potential curriculum stress or mismatch.

Despite attendance being shown, its effect seems minimal or not clearly tied to GPA here — requires deeper breakdown.

GPA remains consistent across ages, indicating age isn’t a strong performance determinant in this sample.

Some students (like Arjun) significantly outperform peers, suggesting high achievers could be role models or subjects for qualitative research.

Clubs like Entrepreneurship Cell and Literary Society also show promising academic alignment.


RECOMMENDATION

Strengthen Research Opportunities: Partner with research institutions or create more projects to sustain the high performance associated with research internships.

Support CSE Students: Investigate course design, faculty quality, or student workload to identify causes of lower GPA.

Promote Productive Clubs: Use the Coding Club model to boost other clubs’ structure and engagement.

Introduce Personalized Learning Plans: For students like Arjun, use their habits and paths as case studies to mentor others.

Refine Attendance Policy: Since GPA impact of attendance isn’t strongly reflected, consider tracking engagement more qualitatively.


Conclusion
The analysis reveals that research-based internships have a positive impact on students’ academic performance, highlighting the value of practical, research-oriented exposure. Departments such as CIVIL and MECH consistently lead in GPA scores, indicating strong academic outcomes in these fields. Participation in the Coding Club is also positively correlated with higher GPAs, emphasizing the benefits of skill-based extracurriculars. However, the underperformance of the CSE branch suggests a need to reassess the curriculum or support systems to address potential academic challenges.
